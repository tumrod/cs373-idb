However, soon after the Battle of Yavin, representatives of the Alliance to Restore the Republic rediscovered the Anointed People and found them to be intelligent and sophisticated, if still not technological. By that point, the Anointed People, mostly under the rule of Godking Trisstan, had made important social advances, replacing their constant warring with a sport-like activity."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The agents of the Alliance tried to convince the Anointed People to join their faction in the Galactic Civil War, but Godking Trisstan was reluctant to agree: he had recently been the victim of Jayhawk, a con artist who claimed to be a member of the Alliance.

The Unwashed were stout serfs and workers, while the Godlings were aristocrats, ruling over a number of Unwashed individuals\u2014mostly through verbose and meaningless speeches\u2014and in turn obeying the Godking's orders. Some Godlings also occupied roles as the Godking's aides.

Consequently, the Unwashed concentrated their leisure time in domestic ventures and entertainment, such as drinking distilled beverages and gambling. In contrast, the Godlings were aware of intelligent life from beyond the stars and understood that it could be a great opportunity for them; at the same time the Godlings were frightened by their limited knowledge of life beyond the stars, including ignorance of the goals and abilities of those aliens.

The marching army would then formally challenge the other Godling to battle and wait for that person to arrange his or her own army. The resulting battle used only clubs\u2014no edged weapons\u2014meaning that the strong bones of the Anointed People protected them from permanent damage; the bludgeoning weapons rarely caused real injuries, and any damage inflicted was comparable to what might be expected from a sports match."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Eventually, one of the belligerents would surrender or retire.

Traditionally a bloodthirsty, militaristic species, the Anointed People were frequently involved in armed territorial disputes during their early history.
