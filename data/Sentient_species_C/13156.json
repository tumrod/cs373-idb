Cragmoloids also suffered frequent attacks by hunters who sought their valuable ivory, a peril that prompted many Cragmoloids to the humiliation of simply off sawing their own tusks off. A small number of Cragmoloids left their world to earn a living among the stars; some of these were Boulad, an information broker living on Coruscant; and Rooty, a gambler and smuggler operating in Hutt Space."}],"images":[]},{"title":"Biology and appearance","level":2,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Cragmoloids were sentient pachydermoids that resembled anthropomorphic elephants, or simply elephants walking on their hind legs. Cragmoloids had stiff, thick, leathery skin that protected them from damage, and two elephantine, flap-like ears. Among the folds of their skin, a Cragmoloid had two sharp, small, red, beady eyes, which opened wide when the individual was surprised. When crying, each of the eyes shed half a liter of water as a tear."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Another pachydermoid trait was the thick facial trunk, which was a manipulative organ: Cragmoloids used their trunk to frisk individuals. They also raised it in moments of surprise. While some Cragmoloids had only one trunk, others had two smaller, secondary trunks surrounding the main one. Cragmoloids had natural tusks under the trunk. These could be used in combat to impale an opponent or during a wrath-driven charge. Some Cragmoloids had two big tusks, while others had four smaller ones. In any case, the tusks could be, and sometimes were, sawed off."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Cragmoloids were massive in size, commonly reaching three meters of height, and weighing over two hundred kilograms in adulthood. Not only big, but also very strong, cumbersome and intimidating, they commonly found that hiding their bulk was a difficult task. Other Cragmoloid physical traits were less pachydermoid. The top of the head presented coarse, stringy hair, at least in some cases. While Cragmoloids had three-toed, clawed feet, their massive five-fingered hands were humanoid in shape and had nails."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Cragmoloids began their adolescence at eight years of age, reaching biological maturity at fifteen.

They also preferred to face setbacks with direct answers instead of what they considered to be dishonorable tricks\u2014something that did not stop them from pursuing careers in organized crime. Duplicity and deception commonly exasperated Cragmoloids, who were prone to violent attacks of rage when angered. Notwithstanding their physical prowess, Cragmoloids believed that unjustified violence was barbaric and to be avoided."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Their civilization was organized into clans. Cragmoloids were so close to their families that they suffered severe depressions if separated from their homes or their friends. A Cragmoloid always preferred chatting about kinship to talking about any other subject, and they commonly praised their direct relatives. Aliens speaking with a Cragmoloid sometimes resorted to asking about their families to obtain the Cragmoloid's trust\u2014although only after enduring many minutes of speeches. Cragmoloids had one-word names. Representative appellations included Akoom, Darak, Ormoj, Urun, Vuula, Bachus, Ganesh and Trusk."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Cragmoloids were an isolated people, commonly speaking only Cragii, the native language of their homeworld.

At some point prior to 22 BBY, the Cragmoloids joined the galactic community. Although a number of Cragmoloids were identified as Force-sensitives, none of them became a Jedi Knight. The Cragmoloids also became prey to professional hunters, who killed the pachydermoids to keep the ivory from the Cragmoloids' valuable tusks. That was not the species' only off-world threat: the Galactic Empire, created in 19 BBY,enslaved all the available Cragmoloids, and the company TaggeCo performed extensive mining on Ankus. These three factors pushed the Cragmoloid species towards extinction.

Ashamed for having turned his massive back to his planet, Rooty hoped to forget his disgrace in a hedonistic search of pleasure and rubbing shoulders with the likes of the Human smugglers Han Solo, Salla Zend and Lando Calrissian. In 1 BBY, Rooty defeated Calrissian at the card game sabacc, winning the 20,000 bet that the Socorran had placed on his hand. Calrissian then admitted he had bet more credits than he actually had available, and offered an alternative payment to Rooty. Understanding that Calrissian was trying to cheat him, the Cragmoloid was enraged and physically threatened Calrissian. A certain Twi'lek bystander offered to pay Rooty the remainder of the debt and, although Rooty agreed, he still retained a dislike for Calrissian in later times."}],"images":[]},{"title":"Behind the scenes","level":2,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"The Cragmoloids first appeared in the 2000 comic book Underworld: The Yavin Vassilika 1, written by Mike Kennedy and drawn by Carlos Meglia.

Both sources recognize that the Cragmoloids can attack with tusks or by ramming, but each source uses different rules for the effects. Ultimate Alien Anthology also provides a table for the Cragmoloid lifespan, while Unusual Suspects suggests that the lifespan of a Cragmoloid equals a Wookiee's. In this last case, this article follows the Anthology lifespan table, because it is the more recent source."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Star Wars: The Essential Atlas Online Companion places the Cragmoloid home planet Ankus in the Mid Rim.
