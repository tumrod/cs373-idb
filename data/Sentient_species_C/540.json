The more oxygen present, the more intense the color of their eyes and skin tone. While their hair was typically jet black, it did on rare occasions go gray with age (most Chiss believed that the development of gray hair was an indication of the siring of exceptional children). Their physical form led to some speculation on whether they were an offshoot of humanity's ancient expansions into the galaxy or whether their physical form coincidentally matched that of Humans. However, genetic analysis indicated that they were an offshoot of humanity, and it was believed that moving underground led to a divergence between them and baseline Humans. Furthermore, this analysis indicated that their unique skin tone was the result of exposure to glacial minerals. Their blue skin, jet black hair and red eyes generally commanded attention once they were in a crowd of regular humanoids, and these features made them physically striking and instantly recognizable.. Male and female Chiss tend to be more powerfully built when compared to Humans but exhibit the same variances as Humanoid sexes. A Chiss stood between either 1.6 to 2.1 meters in height though an average height of an adult was believed to be 1.7 meters."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The University of Sanbra concluded that the fact that all Chiss often appeared in very good physical shape was an indication that the species possessed an active metabolism which was responsible for their trim figure. Thus, this was believed to be responsible for preventing obesity that was commonly found within more sedentary humanoids. While the report concluded that they were indeed near-Humans, they had not determined a specific point of evolutionary divergence. There was, in fact, a Human sleeper ship colony established on Csilla around 27,500 BBY, though records of this were virtually nonexistent and it remained unknown how a remote area of the galaxy could have been trailblazed so far back. They did display, physiologically, very few signs of evolutionary adaptations to their icy environment with even their skin pigmentation not providing any apparent benefit. Beyond the obvious physical features, physiologically, the Chiss were similar to Humans to the point that they possessed a comparable circulatory, neurological, digestive and reproductive systems. The Chiss vocal mechanism was noted for being similar to Humans but there were apparent differences which was evident in their capacity to speak their native language."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"In addition, they experienced a greatly accelerated growth rate compared to Humans, which contributed to their reaching maturity faster than Humans. Thus a Chiss at the age of 10-years held the physical maturity of a 20-year old Human. This in turn resulted in a culturally-imprinted emotional maturity that was many times above that of their Human counterparts. They were capable of living up to 80 years old, at which point a Chiss was considered venerable; children were between ages 1-10, and they experienced a rapid adolescence from 11-12 and were considered full adults by 13-14. Middle-age followed between the ages of 51-62, and those aged 63-79 were considered old."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Certain anthropologists believed that the Nagai were perhaps an offshoot of the Chiss but no legends or history records in either species indicated the validity of such a claim."}],"images":[{"src":"http:\/\/img1.wikia.nocookie.net\/__cb20051128115222\/starwars\/images\/thumb\/9\/97\/Chisswomen.jpg\/180px-Chisswomen.jpg","caption":"Female Chiss"},{"src":"http:\/\/img3.wikia.nocookie.net\/__cb20091215233139\/starwars\/images\/thumb\/4\/48\/TattooedChiss-TNR.jpg\/180px-TattooedChiss-TNR.jpg","caption":"A tattooed Chiss male."}]},{"title":"History","level":2,"content":[],"images":[]},{"title":"Beginnings","level":3,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"The origins of the Chiss were largely unknown, even to the Chiss themselves, though some scientists thought that they were the result of a long forgotten Human colony that had been lost to time.

A report by the University of Sanbra indicated that very little was known of Chiss history due to their own records being carefully guarded on their homeworld. However, scattered reports from many intrepid scholars suggested the Chiss were a forgotten colonization attempt; this theory was mostly based on their resemblance to Humanity. Genetic analysis later confirmed that the Chiss were indeed an offshoot of the Human species' earliest attempts at colonization. It was believed that sometime before 27,000 BBY, a lost colony of Humans settled in the Unknown Regions on the planet Csilla."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"According to Chiss legend, their homeworld was once a warm and tropical planet. However, the planet was later locked in an ice age with profound glaciation encompassing the terrestrial world. This forced the Chiss ancestors to travel along the ice front's leading edge in order to survive at the temperate front as glaciers began spreading across the planet. Though it was believed that the glaciation process occurred over an extended period of time, it was also at an age when the Chiss were already technologically advanced which allowed them to overcome these challenges to their survival by way of technological adaptations. This led many to conclude that the early Chiss existed on Csilla prior to it succumbing to an ice age. Thus, Csilla nearly became inhospitable by 5000 BBY, and it was only by living underground that this divergent species survived. These events furthered the genetic changes notably seen in their skin tone and eyes. Thus it was believed that by going underground, the race gradually began to diverge from the baseline Human species, the glacial mineral content beginning to alter their physiology into its more modern form."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Xenosociologists believed that this period had a profound mental impact on the developing Chiss and led to the evolution to their current mindset. However, little was known of these early Chiss as certain legends indicated that a decadent culture had formed in the tropics that were unprepared for this ice age. Related parables even stated that northern dwelling Chiss slaughtered their decadent southern cousins when resources became sparse and chilling temperatures befell the planet. Regardless, it was known that the Chiss adapted well to their planet during its climatic change and began tapping into geothermal energy as a power source. This led to the building of several populous cities amongst the glaciers and were quick to develop a global government. Thus, they avoided the adolescence period common to developing worlds that saw nations compete with one another, along with adopting a planet-wide tongue. Eventually, their species mastered star travel independently with some speculation that they tapped into the ancient memories of the colonization effort that first brought them to Csilla."}],"images":[{"src":"http:\/\/img3.wikia.nocookie.net\/__cb20101030034624\/starwars\/images\/thumb\/1\/18\/Chiss_TOR.jpg\/190px-Chiss_TOR.jpg","caption":"A Chiss during the reign of the Old Republic"}]},{"title":"The Ascendancy","level":3,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"The initial Chiss star-travel era involved their scientists attempting to create hyperfields over vehicles designed to carry passengers.

He proposed the creation of this group after explorations efforts yielded several resource rich worlds. Much of their expansion was governed by the need to gather resources without upsetting their homeworld's ecosystem. Though their territory later managed to suffice for their growing population, the Chiss continued to expand into space. However, this was not out of exploration of the unknown or out of greed but a leading theory indicated that they sought to impose order over a chaotic region of space. The government on Csilla controlled 28 major colony worlds scattered across Chiss space, united in a political federation known as the Chiss Ascendancy.

A few rare Chiss even achieved official rank in the Imperial military. In this time, Chiss agents were sent on loan to the Imperial Military forces on Hoth where they aided the Ministry of Logistics by providing cold weather training and equipment for skirmishes on the icy world.

Although overt hostile action was formally required as a trigger for retaliation, simple territorial transgression could be interpreted by some Chiss patrol commanders as enough to constitute a violation.

In this era arose a young officer in the Expansionary Fleet known as Thrawn who began to press for the abandonment of the hallowed doctrine that outlawed preemptive strikes. He believed that the Chiss could not place themselves in a situation where they were forced to fight against the Vagaari and the Yuuzhan Vong simultaneously, but while others like Admiral Ar'alani and his brother Syndic Thrass acknowledged the danger, they viewed his enthusiasm for combat and aggressive scouting with some concern."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"In 27 BBY, Thrawn's patrol encountered Corellian traders - the crew of the smuggler ship Bargain Hunter\u2014marking what seems to had been the first modern contact between the Ascendancy and the Old Republic.

The result of this assault led to the start of what became known as the Swarm War with the Chiss taking an active fight against the Killik Colony. The Galactic Alliance would eventually be caught up in the mix once they realized it was the Dark Nest's influence on the colony that was provoking the war. The Chiss Ascendancy was responsible for assaulting the Killik Colony world of Tenupe with a massive ground engagement fought between the two sides. Whilst it seemed that the Chiss were committed to taking the planet with their fleet in place, they were aware of the presence of the Killik Moon Swarm. However, they had planned this defeat with the intention of launching a parasite bomb which would slowly infect the entire Killik race and destroy the Colony as a result as it spread throughout the species. However, the intervention of the Jedi prevented this from occurring though further hostilities ended when the Dark Nest along with its leader Lomi Plo were killed by Master Skywalker whilst Rayner Thul himself was taken into custody by the New Jedi Order.

During that time, the Galactic Alliance suffered greatly for the incident surrounding the Ossus Project which served as an incentive for the Empire to declare war against them.

Every Chiss was known to have claimed affiliation to one of the four families which was determined by both tradition as well as place of birth. In reality, the family names were more of a cultural holdover as the bloodlines had grown so co-meddled that any Chiss could claim affiliation to any of the ruling families. As families themselves were not in competition, rivalries themselves were rare according to one report by the University of Sanbra as a Chiss' allegiance to one family did not normally affect their day-to-day living. In spite of the outward impression of calm and order that the Chiss liked to project to outsiders, there were evidently tensions within the Families. This was evident by the fact that there was a tricky balance of power among the families.

Though Thrawn was an exceptional member of his species, his rational approach to problem solving was shared by the ruling families that governed the Chiss Ascendancy. As a general rule, Chiss did not take part in any action that would bring shame on their house with entire family lines exiled due to the actions of a single member. A tradition of shadow children was also recorded. These were offspring who were kept safely anonymous to prevent a family bloodline being fully exterminated."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The best-documented means of acquiring Family status through merit was that which was attained in the military. For the duration of their service, every officer in the Chiss military was attached to one of the Ruling Families as a \"merit adoptive,\" and while under normal circumstances, this Family status was lost when an individual left the service, those of particular ability were said to be \"born to trial,\" and given the opportunity to make their Family status permanent. If these Trial-born of the Family were successful, they would be permanently \"matched\" to the lineage. Conversely, members of a Ruling Family could apparently also be \"released\" and \"rematched,\" although it is even less clear how this processes operated. It is possible that marriage was involved in matching, although no mention is yet known that indicates an institution of marriage among the Chiss. A hierarchy of leadership within each Family consisted of brothers and sisters (known collectively as siblings), plus cousins, and ranking distant relations\u2014the last being the highest level that the most able Trial-born could reasonably hope to achieve.

Those Chiss caught in the middle of inter-house rivalries spent much of their time in intelligence gathering in order to get useful information that could be used for blackmail even if it was only capable of being used many years in the future. This trait made the Chiss excellent counterintelligence agents with a trained member of their kind able to see through disguises, evaluate body language, detect idiosyncrasies in speech pattern and even distinguish authentic items from forgeries.

As stated by Thrawn, over the various centuries, there had been as many as twelve and as few as three Ruling Families that led the Chiss. The Fifth Ruling Family were the Chaf, who wore yellow, and apparently held a specific portfolio for diplomacy and foreign affairs, while the Second and Eighth Ruling Families shared a military oversight role. It was to the second of these two Families that Thrawn and his brother Thrass belonged; they wore dark red, and naming patterns indicate that they were known as the Mitth family.

It was known that they maintained an impressive fleet which was dedicated to the defense of their territory. In fact, their military was a sizeable force with the Nuruodo family being in charge of both the fleet and the army. As they had never needed to act as a single unit, the military was partitioned into 28 colonial units known as Phalanxes.

While passions themselves were recognized, they were done so with disdain as such energy was believed to be better applied elsewhere. The regimented style of their society meant that crime was abhorred and seen as the weakness of an individual. Blaming society was a notion completely alien to their mindset and justice was given with little thought on compassion. However, the Chiss did not believe in capital punishment as they recognized it as being an irrational, emotionally driven reaction instead of being a true deterrent. Instead, the greatest punishment they gave for their most heinous of crime was exile. Due to the great importance of family loyalty existing in their culture, exile was considered a grave punishment for any Chiss to face."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"During their childhood, Chiss were taught to read through the great stacks of data of the great library on Csilla. These contained basic information that every Chiss absorbed during their childhood after years of intense schooling. Among their kind, there was no period of adolescence as their children matured early and were given adult responsibilities very quickly. Scientists believed that they essentially bypassed the adolescent stage and reached maturity quickly. By the age of ten, they were ready to join military service and wear cadet uniforms. The species were highly reserved in their emotions and often did not display feelings openly; either by smiling or by warm gestures. As such, they rarely were vocal about any feelings of anger or frustration though they did possess some curse words to employ should the situation warrant such an expression."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Though this was the impression projected, the Chiss were also a thoughtful people. While they were deliberate and calculating, they were not above wondering about how certain events might have turned differently had circumstances been altered. Much of their ability to solve problems stemmed from their reliance on data, and when faced with unpredictable situations, typical Chiss behavior meant that they would rather flee in the scene. This was not a universal characteristic as certain individuals with the ability to learn under such circumstances, like Thrawn, were able to continue to fight. In fact, whenever a Chiss suffered a setback or even a defeat, they often contemplated what might had been done differently in order to ensure that a victory was achieved in the next engagement. Chiss were noted for possessing an unparalleled aptitude for tactical thinking. The ideals of the Chiss were idolized in the form of the Red Flame which was a combination of courage, discipline and cunning."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Their society was highly structured and ordered with the rule of law being enforced by the ruling families. These were not biological family groupings but instead different branches of their government. The Csapla dictated colonial issues, natural resources and agriculture whilst the Nuruoda handled the military as well as foreign affairs. Inrokini were responsible for industry, science, communication and non-military technology with the Sabosen taking the duty of overseeing justice, public health as well as education. These ruling families were composed of clans that were headed by government officials known as Aristocras. Those chiss that belonged to the same house defended one another at every opportunity whilst those from competing houses searched for facts that could be used to snipe or undermine the other whilst attempting to secure any advantage for themselves. Though Thrawn was an exceptional member of his species, his rational approach to problem solving was shared by the ruling families that governed the Chiss Ascendancy. Members of the ruling class of Chiss were notable for being an aristocracy within their society."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"As a general rule, Chiss did not take part in any action that would bring shame on their house with entire family lines exiled due to the actions of a single member. The ruling families themselves were quite aware of any opportunity where they were able to exploit the weakness of a rival. As such, they were quick to take offense at any insult that was perceived against their position. Those Chiss caught in the middle of inter-house rivalries spent much of their time in intelligence gathering in order to get useful information that could be used for blackmail even if it was only capable of being used many years in the future. This trait made the Chiss excellent counterintelligence agents with a trained member of their kind able to see through disguises, evaluate body language, detect idiosyncrasies in speech pattern and even distinguish authentic items from forgeries."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The long spacefaring history of the Chiss led to the creation of a superior combat force with their starfighter pilots being infamous throughout the Unknown Regions. Such squadrons were ruled by discipline and their pilots were known to spare disabled starships if they broadcasted a surrender. They also did not celebrate until their duty was completed as any celebrations made before such an event were considered false. Despite this, they were highly committed in their duties and a Chiss warrior, if given an order, would carry it out even if they disagreed with it, which highlighted their belief in the chain of command. It was also known that the Chiss as a culture had an aversion to suicide and expendability as they found those actions to be wasteful. Though this was the case, there were occasions where Chiss gave their lives rather then surrender. In such circumstances, this was either due to the importance of the strategy for their people or because surrendering to a certain foe was considered a fate worse than death."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The Chiss had a keen interest in art and science and were skilled in mathematics. Their thought processes were based around a logical mindset, being interested in philosophy and in learning about other cultures. On the other hand, they were also xenophobic, and any knowledge gained from other cultures was used as a means of gaining a advantage over a potential foe. One notable group of individuals that were involved in deep contemplation were Chiss sages who studied the threat of the Yuuzhan Vong and concluded that the extragalactic invaders must have spent countless generations traveling through the void between galaxies."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Their clinical detachment was similar to how a biologist studied an insect which was how the Chiss view their foes and they often engaged in extreme caution in such circumstances. When among non-Chiss, individual members of the race were often aloof and pensive as they plotted tactics which would ensure a victory if a confrontation were to occur. Chiss never truly lost their xenophobic instincts, even when they were among members of other species for long periods of time. Ultimately, Chiss were loyal to their own kind and looked down upon aliens as being barbaric as well as immature. Despite this fact, most Chiss were considered peaceful and did abide by the strict code of conduct that governed their race. In addition, though xenophobic, they were at times willing to accept members of other races into their ranks so long as they proved to be exceptional as well as trustworthy individuals. Furthermore, the subject needed to prove themselves capable of following Chiss disciplines in order to gain their loyalty and respect. The Chiss were considered an honorable people who did not kill more than they thought was necessary to accomplish their goals. However, they were not above using biological weapons of mass destruction against a foe should it be felt that their survival was threatened."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"When attacked, they responded with calm, intelligent and well-planned strategies while at the same time remaining an honorable species. They never made conflicts personal and were very rarely aggressors as they prefer to let conflicts come to them. Among the most famous traits of their kind was their refusal to invade the territories of other species or even wage war over potential foes. As such, they did not believe in the concept of a preemptive strike against their foes. Rather, they only responded to an enemy assault after their foes had struck first. This was actually a by-product of their cool and cautious philosophy. This was because, in their view, that by allowing their enemy to draw first blood they guaranteed that that they were acting in the right. Furthermore, it divorced their actions from any recklessness which resulted from either impulsive anger or the incomplete intelligence of an enemy's intentions. Striking first was thus an anathema to their discipline with even tactically sound preemptive strikes being the subject of controversy. This moral imperative was so pervasive in their culture that they exiled Thrawn from their society for breaching it. Once attacked, the Chiss did not rest until their attackers were destroyed or completely subjugated."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The Chiss society had no concept of finances or money with everything being provided for by the state. They also maintained tightly controlled borders that were self-sufficient in the isolated territory that they rule. Their colonies supplied them with both food and resources while developing technology comparable to the rest of the galaxy. As such, they saw no need for trade and their culturally derived contempt of \"lesser races\" also prohibited them from forming better relations with their neighbors. In fact, the motive for their exploration and expansion was difficult to determine as they lacked the passion for conquering the unknown which was a trait that Humans possessed. In addition, they did not claim new territory out of greed or for a hunger for power. Their space program was mostly governed by the basic need to manage their population and gathering resources without upsetting their homeworlds ecosystem. Their territory sufficed for their entire population needs. A report by the University of Sanbra indicated that the Chiss population numbered nearly 5 trillion. Despite their growing border, they still fostered a cultural contempt for other species. Instead, they believed in isolation and the preservation of their heritage."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"It was believed by many xenosociologists that the rigid and disciplined nature of Chiss society stemmed from their cold environment on their homeworld. They were noted for displaying no signs of decadent or greedy behavior and thus it was concluded that any signs of colonial expansion were mostly due to the Chiss desiring to put order onto chaotic locations. This was in fact the leading theory by the University of Sanbra who concluded that the motivation for Chiss expansion was their ideal of seeking to impose order on what they saw as a chaotic and barbaric region. Being nearly impossible to enrage, they preferred to only act when all factors had been taken into account with the issue itself analyzed. In addition, they believed firmly in the chain of command as well as positions of authority. In fact, Chiss were taught to respect the position itself rather than the person holding that title. As such, Chiss often responded when an individual called out the rank rather than their name."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Some reports indicated that there were no Chiss Jedi and it was not known whether there was a Force-tradition within Chiss society.

A major problem with understanding Chiss technology is distinguishing specifically Chiss elements from its wider context. For instance, the celebrated Nssis-class Clawcraft was a hybrid of Imperial and Chiss technology, and may have also involved the input of other species. These blue-skinned humanoids were well known for their self-control and intelligence that were traits which translated into a series of well designed as well as innovative starships. Travel through hyperspace required Chiss starships to rely upon a number of navigational anchor points that spread out from Csilla. Such a system allowed the Chiss to explore the galaxy methodically though kept them from encountering other cultures. Due to the secrecy involved in Chiss internal politics, outsiders knew very little about individual Chiss manufacturers."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Some Chiss structures were starkly angular, perhaps inspired by the icy geometries of Csilla's glacial landscape. We can note the double-pyramid shape of the Brask Oto space station in the Redoubt, and the angular, faceted hull-design of the ships of the Fifth Ruling Family, such as Chaf Exalted and Chaf Envoy. However, the distinctive design of these ships was highly symbolic, designed to identify them as Chaf Family consular ships and even to identify the specific status and lineage of the Family members they carried. Combat warships of the Expansionary Fleet had far more curved and fluid hull-lines. To outsiders, clawcraft had only been a recent encounter during the era of the Yuuzhan Vong Invasion. At the time, the University of Sanbra only had limited reports of Chiss capital ships due to the fact that none had been seen in action at the time. A report by the University held the view that the Chiss did not possess a ship larger than a 300 meter escort frigate."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Their hyperdrives were not as efficient as the latest models developed by the Corellian Engineering Corporation though they were competent and quite capable of travelling across the distances of their territory. During their star-travel era, they developed the ability to form hyperfields by using precise irradiation of composite materials. However, the early pioneers of this technology were unable to sustain the field around larger vessels that had been designed to carry passengers. Thus, their scientists worked on creating a habitable hyperspace bubble whilst combating field decay though others worked on outfitting automated drones with early hyperdrives with specialized beacons that was responsible for developing the early navigational anchor-points throughout the Unknown Regions. Modern era Chiss craft used the anchor-points for travelling through Chiss Space which was why their vessels lacked navicomputers. This had the effect of preventing the Chiss from safely leaving their borders."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"By 27 BBY, their ship engines were capable of entering into hyperspace in such a manner that crewmen were at times unable to determine that the ship had jumped which led to some speculation that Chiss hyperdrives were in fact more advanced than the Republic's at that time. Chiss vessels had precise hyperdrives and navicomps capable of making lightspeed microjumps as tactical maneuvers during combat. Their drive system was highly advanced to the point that few ships could match a clawcraft in terms of maneuverability though their hyperdrives were known to malfunction at times. As such, all Chiss vessels possessed an emergency mechanism that allowed them to eject their hyperdrives."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"An offshoot of their hyperdrive technology were Chiss homing beacons that were not only reliable but required very little energy to operate.

To show the Chiss the advantage in droids, he and a group of engineers began working on a prototype droid fighter.

However, a cursory glance indicated that their fighter craft were equipped energy weapons, projectile weaponry and an unknown form of missile launcher. As such, it was easier to say that Chiss weapons technology was different from that of the Republic than to compare it qualitatively. For example in place of ion cannon, Chiss warships used missiles that deployed charged Conner net-like weapons called shock nets that could reach up to a kilometer wide, which could disable and trap light freighters, entire formations of starfighters, or even incoming missile salvos."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The Chiss used a unique type of energy weapon, the charric. This weapon fired a lancing blue beam, sometimes described as a maser, which delivered thermal energy comparable to conventional blaster weapons coupled with a much greater kinetic punch, but lacked a stun-setting.

By the time of the Swarm War, the CEDF had certainly adopted standard blaster and laser technology alongside maser weaponry: Chiss Star Destroyers mounted turbolasers alongside megamasers, while their heaviest tactical artillery pieces, known as MetaCannon, were capable of being configured to fire charric beams, blaster bolts, or physical artillery shells."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"In later decades, some Chiss devices were highly advanced.
