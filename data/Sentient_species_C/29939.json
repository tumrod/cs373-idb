However, when mining outfits attempted to extract these raw materials, Aridus's ionized atmosphere rendered their equipment inoperable.

In 0 ABY, the Kenobi impersonator destroyed the Iron Tower when the devotion shown him by the Chubbits and the Rebel Alliance hero Luke Skywalker prompted him to thwart a ploy by the Sith Lord Darth Vader to lure Skywalker into a trap at the Iron Tower. In the aftermath of the structure's fall, Jixton swore his services to Vader in exchange for an Imperial retreat from the Chubbit homeworld, and in 4 ABY, the New Republic sought an alliance with the species.
